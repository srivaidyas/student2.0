    "The encrypted decrypter algorithm focuses on as the name suggests encrypting and decrypting text. The algorith mis mostly backend fucntional, which means that the frontend sends the data to the backend and the backend databse encryptes said data and stores a multiude of varibles realting to said data in the backend databse. It works like this the frontned databse sends the data to the backend databsae wherein the algorithm works to encrypt the data uinsg a 4 layer encryption algorithm. Tha algorithm first encrypts the data using a ceaser cipher, then is sorts is laphbetically, then is swpas the first and last letters, then the algorithm swithces vowels for speacial characters. This multi layer algorithm works towards encryptingdata in a way that is almost impposbile to decypt without a special key that includes how the creaser cipher is shifted. The number of letters the ceaser cipher is shifted is whatt he previous sentnces means."

    "In our final project, we plan to create a symmetric encrypted and decrypted algorithm that encrypts and decrypts code in a specific key. We plan to either generate a key or use the ASCII key to encrypt and decrypt text. Our UI functions as follows- the user inputs text and clicks a button that sends said text to the backend API. Once the text is sent, the backend has code that will encrypt the data and store it in the database. The encrypted data is then sent to the frontend UI wherein the code decrypts the text. Since a backend network is involved we most likely plan to create a symmetric algorithm wherein the presence of a public and private key creates a more secure system. We also plan to provide the user with a secret message each time they send data to be encrypted to help with the sorting and searching algorithms. The secret key would assign each word of the data with a specific number according to their initial arrangement and when the words are mixed it would be easy to decrypt the messaging on the front end.\n",
