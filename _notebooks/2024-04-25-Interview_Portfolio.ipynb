It is an API movie and series search box wherein the suer can input the movie name and search for it across the API database which the TMBD site provides for free. This heaven of knowldge and my personal liking towards movies is what prompted me to make this project. The porject showcases my experices in the frontend field.\n",

The project features a tic tac toe game wherein the user plays tic tac toe with a computer program that tires to resist all effort from teh user to win. Futhermore, this code also uses a backend database as one of its functions which shows my gradual tranformation from a soley frontend developer into a fronted depended on the backend kind of developer as the real field requires the intergration of both fields for an effective product.\n",
